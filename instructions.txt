Build in memory, as a structure of interconnected nodes, the graph described by these files:
   http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/class/een318/intersections.txt
   http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/class/een318/connections.txt
   http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/class/een318/geog.txt

( Remember that when logged in to rabbit, these files can be opened by replacing the
  "http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu" with "/home/www", for example:
  f.open("/home/www/class/een318/intersections.txt"); )

Your program should then ask the user to specify a starting location, and allow him/her/it
to interactively navigate through the map.
